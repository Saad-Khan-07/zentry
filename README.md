This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This project is a React-based clone of the Zentry Gaming website, created for the purpose of strengthening UI development skills. It leverages a variety of modern front-end technologies to replicate the original website's look and feel.

**Key Libraries Used:**

* **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** For creating smooth and performant animations.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.
* **React Icons:** A library providing a wide range of popular icons.
* **React Hooks:** For managing state and side effects within functional components.
* **react-use:** A collection of useful React Hooks.

Through the process of building this clone, I gained significant experience and a deeper understanding of:

* **Tailwind CSS:** Implementing complex layouts and styling efficiently using utility classes.
* **Animations:** Utilizing GSAP to bring engaging and dynamic elements to the user interface.
* **UI Development:** Applying React principles and best practices to structure and build a responsive and visually appealing website.
